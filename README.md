# Free Chat Rooms

## Create Public/Private Stateless Chat Rooms

Made with React, this web application allows users to instantly create private or public chat rooms, and start sending messages right away. The chats are stateless - meaning they're not stored in a database, and no credential other than a username is required to use this application.

You can also peek in one of the available public rooms and take part in completely random conversations, or create one instead and invite people over.

Private rooms require a password, and you can either share the link of the room, or the room credentials with a friend to begin chatting.
